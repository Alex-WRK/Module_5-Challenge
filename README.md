#### Analysis
In this data analysis, we investigated a mouse study dataset to gain insights into the effectiveness of various treatment regimens on tumor volume. We performed data cleaning, summary statistics calculation, data visualization, and statistical analysis to understand the relationships between variables and draw meaningful conclusions.

#### Data Cleaning and Exploration
This initial phase of the analysis involved data cleaning and exploration. The mouse data and study were merged into a single DataFrame to consolidate relevant information. Duplicate data was identified based on unique identifiers and inconsistencies were resolved. The cleaned dataset comprised information on mouse characteristics, treatment regimens, tumor volume and other relevant data points.

#### Summary Statistics
Summary statistics were calculated to gain insights into the tumor volume distribution across different drug regimens. Mean, median, variance, standard deviation and standard error were computed for each regimen. The resulting statistics table provided a comprehensive overview of the tumor volume characteristics for each drug regimen.

#### Data Visualization
Visualization played a key role in understanding the dataset and communicating the findings. Bar charts were used to visualize the total number of data points for each drug regimen, offering a clear comparison among the treatements. Pie charts were used to illustrate the gender distributuion among the mice, helping to provide an overview of the study's composition. Box plots helped in understanding the distribution and potential outliers in tumor volume across different treatment groups.

#### Statistical Analysis
Correlation analysis was conducted to evaluate the relationshipo between mouse weight and avegrage observed tumor volume for the Capomulin regiment. Linear regreassion analysis was performed to model the relationship between mouse weight and timor volume, and to assess the signficance of the regression parameters.

Based on my analysis, the following key findings were observed

The dataset contained 248 unique mice
The most promising regimens were Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubino and Ceftamin, which showed varying levels of effectiveness in reducing tumor volume.
The Capomulin regimen showed a strong negative correlation between mouse weight and average tumor volume, indicating that heavier mice tended to have larger tumor volumes.
